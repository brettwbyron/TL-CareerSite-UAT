  devSiteUrl?: string;
  uatFolderUrl?: string;
  contactEmails?: string;
  passwordHash: string;
  version: number;
  columns: Column[];
  disableAddTask: boolean;
}
```

**Task**:
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  description: string;
  type?: 'Change Request' | 'Issue' | 'Feature';
  device: 'All' | 'Desktop' | 'Mobile';
  feedback: FeedbackItem[];
  section: string;
  owner?: 'PM' | 'Developer' | 'Account';
  createdAt: string;

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Framework**: SvelteKit (Svelte 5)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$effect`, `$derived`, `$bindable`)
- **API Integration**: Octokit (GitHub REST API)
- **Storage**: GitHub repository (JSON files)
- **Deployment**: Static site (GitHub Pages compatible)

### Security
- **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 (client-side)
- **Token Exposure**: GitHub token visible in client code (acceptable for non-sensitive UAT data)
- **Access Control**: Password-based, not foolproof but sufficient for trusted accounts
- **Session**: SessionStorage for persistence (client-side only)

### Performance
- Efficient filtering with derived state
- Debounced auto-save
- Minimal re-renders
- Image compression to reduce bandwidth
- Lazy loading for large boards

### Code Quality
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Comprehensive type definitions in `types.ts`
- Clean component architecture
- Reusable utility functions
- Proper event handling
- Error handling with user feedback
